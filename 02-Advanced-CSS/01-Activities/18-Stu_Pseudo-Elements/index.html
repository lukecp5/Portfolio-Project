              <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</span> is a style sheet language that describes
              the presentation of a webpage. If <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</span> is the skeleton of a
              webpage, then <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span> is the meat on the bones. Whereas <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</span> strictly
              pertains to webpage markup, <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span> deals with colors, aesthetics, and
              visual layout. It hooks onto specific elements of an <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</span> page and
              formats them using any number of style options.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, jumping into <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span> isn't always straightforward. As it
              often goes in web development, formatting visual styles on a
              website requires an explicit level of detail and a precise command
              of the language. Remember that creating web applications isn't a
              drag-and-drop process; colors, aesthetics, fonts, and visual
              layouts all need to be coded in order for every browser to
              consistently render the page correctly.

          <h2>How CSS Works</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span> code references specific <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</span> elements and then applies
              changes to how they're formatted. The format options are called
              properties in <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span>, and they can be modified in various specific
              ways. Don't expect to memorize all of the formatting options
              available through <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span>. For many of your early weeks and months as
              a developer, you'll need to continually reference websites to find
              the exact syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Believe it or not, you can build complex web layouts through
              simple <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</span> and <span tabindex="0" data-descr="Commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</span> alone!
