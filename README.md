# Portfolio-Project
This is a professional portfolio that I have built from scratch. I created it to display my abilities as a web developer. It uses flexboxes and media queries to accomplish a fully responsive layout in every way. Just a few of the responsive features of my portfolio include:
- Responsive Images
- Collapsible navigation menu 
- Text resizing for the various screen sizes
- Flexboxes that change direction based on the screen width
- Other modern methods for resizing content based on a users device

As of now, it only has one active project in the portfolio section. I plan to add to the portfolio section, and clean up the look of the site as I add to it. This project was a blast. I look forward to filling out the portfolio with my future work in my GA Tech Coding Bootcamp class, as well as my projects outside of class.
