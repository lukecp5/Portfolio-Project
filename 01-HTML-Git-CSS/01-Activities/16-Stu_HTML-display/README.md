K# 🐛 List Items and Boxes Are Not Displaying Correctly

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* Users should be able to see a horizontal navigation bar with three list items side-by-side.

* Users should be able to see three boxes.

* Users should be able to see the boxes centered and stacked on top of each other.

## Expected Behavior

* All three list items in the navigation bar should display inline.

* All three boxes should be visible. 

* Each box should appear centered and on its own line.

## Actual Behavior

* Each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line.

* Two boxes are visible, and one is not displayed.

* The two visible boxes display inline and aligned to the left. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
